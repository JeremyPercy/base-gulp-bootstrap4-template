# Gulp, Bootstrap 4 base-template

I created a base template providing Bootstrap 4 (Beta 3) with gulp tasks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Clone the repository to your computer, in any desired directory.

When successful make sure you have node.js installed on your computer then you can start working on the project by using the following commandline.
first install gulp globally:
```
npm install gulp -g
```
then:
```
npm install
```

Now you can make use of gulp by entering the follow line in the terminal and your up and running.

```
npm start
```

## How to
 You can make edit, create or remove Sass/scss and JS in the src directory. However you can direct edit the html files in the web directory. All scss and js files will be compiled in a minified version in the web/assets directory.
 You dont have to worry about dependencies they are already added with npm and compiled. Such as Jquerie and popper.js, which is needed for bootstrap. 

## Deployment

You can use the web directory to deploy it to your webhosting.
